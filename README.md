# OperatingSystem_notes_SZTE_hun

This repository contains the recommended notes for the *Operating systems practice* (Operációs rendszerek gyakorlat) at the University of Szeged, Informatics Institute, Hungary. I prepared it in 2011 and had many updates until 2013. Since then I made minor modifications. 

Please let me know if you find any error, mistake or you just have an idea how to expand it.
